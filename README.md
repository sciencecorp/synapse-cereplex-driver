# Blackrock CerePlex Synapse Driver

You need to install cerebus.cbpy from [CerebusOSS/CereLink](https://github.com/CerebusOSS/CereLink), which is not available via a package manager. The simplest way is to download and install a prebuilt wheel for your operating system from a recent release. (At time of writing, [v7.6.4](https://github.com/CerebusOSS/CereLink/releases/tag/v7.6.4) is current.)

To run:

    python -m synapse_cereplex
